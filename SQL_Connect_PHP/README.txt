This is the replacement PHP file for the tutorial. If you have not downloaded the module from the first tutorial on 'How to build a module for Joomla 1.7'
 you need to do that first. 

Replace this php file in the module/test_module folder.

Also you will need to replace the SQL information within the PHP file with a valid SQL table in your Database.

If you need any help just leave a comment.
